# Comparative Analysis of Multi-Level Reinforcement Learning Trading Systems: From PPO Baseline to Advanced Hybrid Approaches

## Abstract

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of four distinct levels of reinforcement learning (RL) trading systems: PPO Baseline (Static Multimodal RL), Level 1 (Basic GRPO), Level 2 (Hybrid GR²PO), and Level 3 (Hierarchical Multi-Task RL - H-MTR). We propose a novel "Hybrid GR²PO" system that combines both "Gated Recurrent Policy Optimization" and "Group Relative Policy Optimization" concepts, achieving superior performance compared to all baseline approaches. Our experimental results on cryptocurrency trading demonstrate that the proposed Hybrid GR²PO achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.89, maximum drawdown of -16.2%, and cumulative return of 258.4%, significantly outperforming the PPO baseline (1.35 SR, -24.8% MDD, 185.2% return), basic GRPO (-1.16 SR, -20.96% MDD, -14.74% return), and hierarchical multi-task RL approaches (1.82 SR, -16.8% MDD, 241.7% return). The comprehensive four-level analysis provides insights into the evolution of RL trading systems and establishes a framework for future research in adaptive ensemble trading strategies.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

The application of reinforcement learning (RL) in algorithmic trading has evolved significantly from basic policy gradient methods to sophisticated ensemble approaches. Traditional RL trading systems often struggle with market regime changes, temporal dependencies, and the need for adaptive decision-making in volatile financial markets. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a multi-level approach that systematically improves upon existing methodologies, starting from the established PPO baseline.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This study aims to:
1. **Analyze four levels of RL trading system sophistication** from PPO baseline to advanced hybrid approaches
2. **Propose Hybrid GR²PO** as an optimal solution combining multiple GRPO concepts
3. **Provide empirical evidence** of performance improvements across different market conditions
4. **Establish a framework** for future RL trading system development

### 1.3 Contributions

- **Comprehensive four-level analysis framework** for RL trading system evaluation
- **Novel Hybrid GR²PO architecture** combining gated recurrent and group relative optimization
- **Performance comparison** across PPO baseline and three sophistication levels
- **Real-world cryptocurrency trading validation** with 6-month market data

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Reinforcement Learning in Trading

Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for algorithmic trading, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as a foundational algorithm. PPO's stability and sample efficiency make it suitable for trading applications, but its limitations in handling temporal dependencies and market regime changes have motivated the development of more sophisticated approaches.

### 2.2 PPO Baseline: Static Multimodal RL

The PPO baseline represents the foundation of our research, implementing a static multimodal reinforcement learning system that combines candlestick chart patterns, technical indicators, and news sentiment analysis. This baseline system achieves a Sharpe ratio of 1.35 and serves as the reference point for all subsequent improvements.

**Key Features of PPO Baseline:**
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: Combines visual (candlestick charts), technical (15 indicators), and sentiment (news analysis) data
- **Static Policy**: Single policy approach that applies uniform strategy across all market conditions
- **ResNet-18 CNN**: Pre-trained convolutional neural network for chart pattern recognition
- **XGBoost Regime Classification**: Market state identification (bull, bear, sideways)

### 2.3 Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)

GRPO represents a significant advancement over traditional PPO by introducing two key concepts:

**Gated Recurrent GRPO**: Integrates Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) into the policy network to capture temporal dependencies in financial time series data. This approach enables the agent to learn from sequential market patterns and make decisions based on historical context.

**Group Relative GRPO**: Implements collaborative learning among expert agents based on relative performance metrics. The relative reward function R_relative = (R_individual - μ_group) / σ_group ensures that agents learn from both individual success and group dynamics.

### 2.4 Ensemble Learning in Trading

Ensemble methods have demonstrated superior performance in trading applications by combining multiple specialized agents. However, traditional ensemble approaches often lack adaptability to changing market conditions and may suffer from overfitting to historical data.

### 2.5 Hierarchical Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (H-MTR)

H-MTR represents the most advanced approach in our four-level hierarchy, combining hierarchical reinforcement learning with multi-task learning capabilities. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional ensemble methods by implementing a master-worker architecture where a high-level master agent coordinates multiple specialized worker agents.

**Key Features of H-MTR:**
- **Master-Worker Hierarchy**: Strategic decision-making at the master level, tactical execution at the worker level
- **Shared Backbone**: Common recurrent memory backbone for efficient knowledge transfer
- **Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting during continual learning
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Simultaneous learning of multiple trading strategies

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Multi-Level System Architecture

We propose a four-level hierarchy of RL trading systems:

#### PPO Baseline: Static Multimodal RL
- **Architecture**: Single PPO agent with multimodal data integration
- **Features**: Candlestick charts, technical indicators, news sentiment
- **Complexity**: Low (single agent, static policy)
- **Performance**: 1.35 SR, -24.8% MDD, 185.2% return

- **Features**: Multi-task learning with elastic weight consolidation
- **Complexity**: High (complex hierarchical structure)
- **Performance**: 1.82 SR, -16.8% MDD, 241.7% return

### 3.2 PPO Baseline System Design

#### 3.2.1 Multimodal Data Processing

The PPO baseline processes three types of heterogeneous data:

**Visual Features (F_visual ∈ R^256)**:
- 60-hour OHLCV data converted to 224×224 candlestick chart images
- ResNet-18 CNN for pattern extraction
- Captures support/resistance levels and candlestick patterns

**Technical Features (F_tech ∈ R^15)**:
- 15 key technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Min-Max normalization to [0, 1] range
- Momentum, volatility, and trend strength measurement

**Sentiment Features (F_senti ∈ R^2)**:
- News sentiment analysis using DeepSeek-R1 (32B) model
- 24-hour rolling average and EWMA sentiment scores
- Range: -1 (extremely negative) to +1 (extremely positive)

#### 3.2.2 Market Regime Classification

XGBoost-based classifier identifies market regimes:
- **Bull Market**: 20 EMA > 50 EMA > 200 EMA
- **Bear Market**: 20 EMA < 50 EMA < 200 EMA  
- **Sideways**: Mixed EMA arrangements

#### 3.2.3 PPO Training

- **Learning Rate**: 3e-4
- **Batch Size**: 64
- **Discount Factor**: 0.99
- **Policy Network**: MLP(273 → 128 → 64 → 5 actions)

### 3.3 Hybrid GR²PO System Design

#### 3.3.1 Dual Agent Architecture

The Hybrid GR²PO system employs two specialized agents:

1. **Gated Recurrent Agent (GRA)**: Specializes in temporal pattern recognition using GRU networks
2. **Group Relative Agent (GRA)**: Focuses on collaborative learning and relative performance optimization

#### 3.3.2 Dynamic Ensemble Mechanism

The ensemble combines agent decisions using adaptive weighting:

```
w_t = softmax([α * R_GRA(t), β * R_GRA(t)])
```

where α and β are learnable parameters that adapt to market conditions.

#### 3.3.3 Market Regime Detection

XGBoost-based classifier identifies market regimes (bull, bear, sideways) and adjusts ensemble weights accordingly:

```
if regime == "bull":
    w_GRA *= 1.2  # Increase temporal pattern weight
elif regime == "bear":
    w_GRA *= 1.2  # Increase collaborative learning weight
```

### 3.4 H-MTR System Design

#### 3.4.1 Master-Worker Architecture

The H-MTR system implements a sophisticated hierarchical structure:

**Master Agent (Strategic Level)**:
- **Role**: Market regime analysis and strategic decision-making
- **Architecture**: GRU(256, 2 layers) + MLP(128, 64)
- **Output**: High-level trading strategy decisions
- **Memory**: Shared recurrent backbone for temporal understanding

**Worker Agents (Execution Level)**:
1. **Trend Follower Agent**: Specializes in momentum-based strategies
2. **Mean Reversion Agent**: Focuses on contrarian trading approaches
3. **Volatility Trader Agent**: Manages risk through volatility-based positioning

#### 3.4.2 Shared Backbone Mechanism

The shared backbone provides common feature extraction:
```
Shared_Features = GRU_Backbone(Input_Sequence)
Master_Output = Master_Policy(Shared_Features)
Worker_Outputs = [Worker_Policy_i(Shared_Features) for i in range(3)]
```

#### 3.4.3 Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)

EWC prevents catastrophic forgetting:
```
L_EWC = L_task + λ_EWC * Σ(F_i * (θ_i - θ*_i)²)
```
where F_i represents Fisher information matrix elements.

#### 3.4.4 Multi-Task Learning Coordination

Task scheduling follows round-robin approach:
```
Task_Weight = [0.4, 0.3, 0.3]  # Trend, Mean Reversion, Volatility
Current_Task = Task_Weight[episode % 3]
```
